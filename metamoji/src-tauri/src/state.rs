//! Application state and the explicit boot sequence.
//!
//! docs/14 §3 catalogues the original's startup: a long chain of static
//! singletons each with its own `initialize()`, ordered only by the order of
//! calls in `Application.onCreate()`, with no dependency injection anywhere.
//! docs/14 §4's recommendation is to replace that with one state object built
//! in an explicit order and a "ready" signal to the UI. That is what this is.
